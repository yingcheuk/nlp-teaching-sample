# NLP Teaching Sample  

This repository contains a short extract from teaching material I contributed to as a HiWi student assistant in a university-level data science course, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.  

The included sample demonstrates how I structured and explained core NLP concepts â€” in this case, tokenization â€” using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing framework.  

Due to university policy, this is a self-contained example and not part of the full lecture content.

> ðŸ§  **Note:**  
> This repository contains a small extract from a larger set of teaching materials I helped develop for an NLP-focused course. The full content covers a broad range of topics including:
> 
> - Text preprocessing techniques  
> - Word embeddings and vector semantics  
> - Sequence modeling and encoder-decoder frameworks  
> - Transformer architectures (e.g. GPT)  
> 
> Due to university policy, only a limited portion is shared publicly. This sample is intended to demonstrate my teaching style and understanding of NLP concepts.
