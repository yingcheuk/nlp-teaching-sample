# NLP Teaching Sample  

This repository contains a short extract from teaching material I contributed to as a HiWi student assistant in a university-level data science course, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.  

The included sample demonstrates how I structured and explained core NLP concepts—in this case, tokenization—using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing framework.  

Due to university policy, this is a self-contained example and not part of the full lecture content.
